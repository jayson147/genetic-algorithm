# ü§ñ Robot Motion Planning using Genetic Algorithm 

To implement a genetic algorithm to discover an optimal path through an evolutionary process. This involves making use of crossover and mutation operators. 

## ‚ùì Problem Definition

- The first step in motion planning
is to create a representation of the robot's operating environment. This involve
constructing a map that includes information about obstacles, terrain, and other relevant
features.
- The next step is Localization. Localization in robot planning refers to the process of
determining the robot's precise position and orientation within its operating environment.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Problem Solving using Genetic Algorithms 

- In formulating the problem as an optimization challenge for resolution by a Genetic
Algorithm (GA), two key elements are essential: defining an objective function and
specifying the variables of that function along with their bounds.
- The objective function,
in this context, is the length of the path, where a shorter path is considered more
favourable.
- The optimization variables are the coordinates (x, y) of each of the fixed number of
points along the path. The variable bounds are determined such that each point resides
within the map.

## üß¨ Implementing Genetic Algorithm 

- The algorithm does make use of appropriate crossover and mutation operators.
- 3 selection methods including Roulette wheel
selection (RWS), Tournament selection and Rank-based Selection
-  2 appropriate cross-over operators 
-  2 mutation operators
